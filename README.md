# foundry-animation-macros
This is a collection of Macros I've compiled for use with the JB2A Animations Patreon Module. These are based on the D&D 5e system, but can be used for other systems as well.

## About the Macros
99% of these macros will function with just **Midi-Qol**, **JB2A Patreon module** and **FXMaster**. The Furnace is suggested, and I will be uploading a new compendium in the following week that utilizes Midi-Qol automation to help run the animations.

The Compendiums in this module are separated as such:
1. Spell Animations
2. Ranged Weapon Attacks
3. Melee Weapon Attacks
4. Explosions
5. Miscellaneous

## Fun Add-Ons

For further fun I have added the following to all of the macros:
**NOTE**: THESE ARE INACTIVE (commented out) and will need to be activated to use

1. Audio: Each has a section to add an audio path and file to play a sound effect along with the animation. Some even have a randomizing audio call to switch up the sounds.

2. Token Magic FX: I have added in some fun Token Magic FX (requires module) that can be activated to give more 'oomph' to the effects. I left these inactive for now, but may activate them on a later release depending on feedback. They really are fun!

## How to Use these Macros

Most every macro can be used without attaching it to an item/spell. They can sit in the macro bar and be used at-will.
For use in conjuction with an item/spell, instructions are as follows:

Bare Minimum Instructions for use:
**NOTE** 1st check out the Tutorial video by JB2A that gives a good run down of how to use these types of macros: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=264xZJjPHD8 

1. In the Midi-Qol workflow settings, at the very bottom, is a check box for "Add macro to call on use". Ensure this is checked

2. This activates a new fillable field "One Use Macro" in the item/spell details page, also at the bottom.

3. Import whichever macro you would like to use into your world.

4. Add the name of the macro you would like to use in the "On Use Macro" field. This MUST match exactly the name of the macro (case sensitive). I suggest copy/pasting from the macro to ensure no errors are made.

Now you're ready to go!

Whenver you use the item/spell, it will call the macro once the damage is rolled. **For 99% of these, you will need to have a target(s) Targeted, and the casting/hitting token Selected**. Some have options to play the animation on the "selected" token instead of the targeted token, such as the Explosions in the Misc Compendium.
